# Bike-Sharing-Analysis-in-R
The bike-sharing prediction model is project where we tried to predict the count of bikes based on various environmental factors such as temperature, wind, weather. Some of the investors try to come with an investment in the bike-sharing for their business point of view. They could not understand how they can invest money in that business process. So, for their cash flow and business profit, we need to build a model that can predict and forecast the count of rides through processing on factors including season, weather conditions and temperature. The dataset contains the corresponding weather and seasonal information about the rental bikes between 2011 and 2012 in the capital bike share system. The dataset contains the hourly and daily counts of rental bikes. This dataset consists of two CSV files such as day.csv and hour.csv. The main motive behind this Project and analysis is to figure out what are the reasons and factors that influence the count of bikes in such a manner that investors can invest their share money in this business.
